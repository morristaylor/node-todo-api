# node-todo-api
## Repo to track my progress in Andrew Mead and Rob Percival's ["The Complete Node.js Developer Course (2nd Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/ "The Complete Node.js Developer Course")"

#### I'm building a Todo App API. My past work for this course [started here](https://github.com/morristaylor/complete-node). On November 5, 2018, I moved this section of the course to its own repo for (eventual) Heroku deployment.
